    "answer": {
      "text": "D",
      "explanation": "A normal distribution is symmetric and assumes data is evenly distributed around the mean. When the data is heavily right-skewed, the normal distribution poorly models the probability since it underestimates the likelihood of extreme high values. Therefore, option D correctly appraises that the normal distribution is inappropriate for such skewed data."

       "The normal distribution is effective because it approximates any distribution with a large sample size due to the Central Limit Theorem.",
       "It is appropriate since the mean and variance are sufficient statistics for modeling right-skewed data with a normal distribution.",
       "Using a normal distribution is justified because skewness does not affect the probability estimates significantly.",
       "The normal distribution is ineffective because it assumes symmetry, which contradicts the heavy right skewness observed."

    "answer": {
      "text": "Discrete probability distributions assign probabilities to countable outcomes, using a probability mass function (PMF) where $P(X = x_i)$ gives the probability of each specific outcome. Continuous probability distributions, however, deal with uncountably infinite outcomes over intervals, using a probability density function (PDF) $f(x)$, where probabilities are found by integrating over intervals: $P(a \\leq X \\leq b) = \\int_a^b f(x) \\, dx$.",
      "explanation": "The key difference lies in the nature of the random variable's domain: discrete variables take distinct values allowing direct probability assignment via PMFs, while continuous variables take values over intervals, requiring calculation of probabilities as areas under the PDF curve. This affects interpretationâ€”discrete probabilities are exact for individual points, but continuous probabilities for single points are zero and only intervals have non-zero probability. Thus, probability calculation shifts from summation in discrete cases to integration in continuous cases."
